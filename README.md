Script to render Golly's simulations into Blender file

# Prerequisites
[Golly](http://golly.sourceforge.net/)
[Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
Python 3.x.x

# Usage
1) Clone this repo
2) Edit config.json
3) Launch Golly, and use `Area Select` tool to mark territory which will be
rendered by Blender
4) In Golly: `File->Run Script...` and select `goly_script.py` file. Dialog will
pop up. I recommend using no more than 20 generations for first tests.
